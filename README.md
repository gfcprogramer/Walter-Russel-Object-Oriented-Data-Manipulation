# Walter-Russel-Object-Oriented-Data-Manipulation
The absolute way to work with huge data with zero lost in efficiency. The base for create the perfect phisics engine that will cost a thousant fraction of actual processing, It can use iddle or predictable moving data as computational power.

Ideia: Working fast with Infinite Objects.
This Idea consists in using Water Russel knowledge of the Creation of Universe to split a simple object as if it was the entire system. (millions of bits)
If we think of the big object as two portions, we reach the first binary. 0 and 1.
A full system can be used if we could predict its movement.
But there is no movement. only totality.
is like a cone in how wide open we see the whole.
The tip of the cone is a point, or the atom, the tinyest portion of the whole.
 the base, the whole or 1, actually being the near we can get of 1. being 9.9inf...

If a computer could threat each part of the whole selected, all the knowledge would englobe the entire of the system. There would be never loss of memory. Because it would allways follow the equation of the whole, the frequencey would be allways the same? The larger its travel, the long it takes to compute the whole, but most of time, you will focus on some aspect that will repeat on everthing like a mirror.
Each movement we do affects the entire universe. 
But its wave cannot be detected. 
And its size seems to be so big or so tiny that no effect seems to happen.
Like emotional karma, it comes back eventually.  All actions.

Recording:
The challenge later is to know how that movement can be all,  ever recorded in light, in the boundaryes into light,  trough the noble gases.
It actually seems more simple to understand now, being simple and growing into complex!
The light is recorded because the movement of the plane goes in high speed, with 2 values, and lower speed when divided by 8, 64, 256, 1024.
It seems slower but just if you count the 1 wave out of 1 / 1024 bits from the 8 bit perspective, it seems much slower.
As vice versa example:
If you see the 2 bits from the 1024 bits  perspective, it is simple, it runs almost like a teleport, as going from 1 to 1024, because when there is only 2 spaces, you see a single flip, while in the 1024 bits, it would cost 1023 flips. This is the illusion of the time dimension. 
If god had eyes as we know, he would see us very slow, the whole frozem frame....
We can manipulate matter as alchemyst because mineral looks frozem. 
We cannot easily do the same with humans, because it runs too fast to catch up a good control, and see the soul displacement, without turning someone else into the super-human or semi-god healm.
