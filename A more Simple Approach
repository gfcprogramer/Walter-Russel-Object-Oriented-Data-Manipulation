"This is the Seeds of knowledge.
If it grows, depends if you place on condensed fertile terrain or your Ideas.
Or in the vast ignorant desert of your disesteem, or scorn."

Today the big mistake the science do is to have mass and weight as independent properties of matter.
They consider the gravity as "misterious" Invisible force, or Weight or Inertia.
Gravity is not more than density medium rest positions for consensed space layers or dark light, 
or space condensed into matter and vice versa, but simultaneously, following the ludion experiment.

* The very simple initial approach:
Clear out those objet properties, mass acceleration,  phisics substitute completely
by the overall matter-space laws, applied to all matters.
The entire growing universe in pc, can be simulated by a single trigger or loop within the WR laws.

Walter Russel LAW:
--+ Expansion pressure is in direct ratio to the square of the distance, degree, 
area, plane orbit or time unity, & to the cube of the volume.
++- Contractio pressure is in inverse ratio to the square of the distance, degree,
area, plane, orbit, or time unity, and to the cube of the volume.
Every mass in the universe occupies a measurable potential position
Condensed space into matter, it will create also the space around it, 
people know as dark energy or whatever they are peased invent as name.

Mass is condensation of only one absolute space. And no one seems to understand this today.
The same space you see above, is the same One element that creates the dense ground you step in.
Universal One condensed into mass, and simultaneously expanded back into space, but Ritmic, allways balanced,
iterchanging constantly, seems frozen to us, or to fast to see, but constant moviment to universe.

"No one borns knowing, they need a trigger, a dead or alive master, 
with living knowledge to make you remenber"
