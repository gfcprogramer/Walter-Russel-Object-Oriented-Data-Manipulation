the movement - What I can state for now using Walter Russel Knowledge
Reflexion:
The whole is 10. Actually number 1 but also 0 from other perspective. They are the same at first - there is no manifestation.

The movement is the key of the manfiestation.
The 1 become 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
the 0 become 0.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999998
In a whole today, simple computational power computer.
This is the first binary 0 and 1.

The movement:
It goes from one to other, with one flip, flashing like teleport.

The whole contracts into a point and the point expands into a whole.
But happens suddenly.
Those decimals are ignored. It happens in a single flip.
0.9 => 0.1
0.1 => 0.9
Flashing instantaneously.
It cannot happen instantaneously today.
but it can only be simulated.

The true terminal or absolute velocity you can cross the entire universe in one flip. No interval.
It can be perceived only if you see from under dimensions, as it have no time, so not time between flips in first dimension.

But once we reach the forth dimention, so the time can be sincronized with real matter.
The fourth dimension is the carbon one. The densest perfect cube sphere element in our universe.

Not exact, just the Idea, I cannot think well right now.
0.1 => 0.4 => 0.8 => 0.9 
0.9 => 0.8 => 0.4 => 0.1

This movement must be flashing in instantaneous / divided by 4, maybe light speed in the power of 4...

They must happen simultaneously. they happen. Depends from where you see them.
The whole from above seems a point if you dont view the base of the cone.
The whole from the base seems a big circle, if you don't view the point at the tip behind him.
The conscience of point only happens from the third dimention, it seems.
